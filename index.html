            <h3 class="title">Air Pollution</h3>
            <p class="text">Air pollution emissions have declined in the last two decades resulting, in better air quality. Despite this improvement, Air pollution remains the largest environmental health risk in INDIA(Delhi). The capital territory of india acording to W.H.O survey of 1,650 world cities, and the surveys of 7,000 worlds ities by the us based Health Effects Institutes in august 2024, is the worst of any major cities in the world it also affects the districts around delhi.Air pollution in india is estimated to kill about 2 million peoples every year it is the fifth largest killer in India. India has the world's highest death rate from chronic respiratory diseases and asthma, according to the WHO. In Delhi, poor quality air irreversibly damages the lungs of 2.2 million or 50 percent of all children. </p>

            <p class="text">Delhi's pollution problem is also caused by the factor of animal agriculture, as smog and other harmful particles are produced by farmers burning their crops in other states since the 1980s. About 80% of agriculturally used land is used for animal agriculture, so animal agriculture can also be attributed as a factor in Delhi's air pollution problem.Initiatives such as a 1,600km long and 5km wide The Great Green Wall of Aravalli green ecological corridor along Aravalli Range from Gujarat to Delhi which will also connect to the Sivalik Hills range is being considered with planting of 1.35 billion (135 crores) new native trees over 10 years to combat the pollution. In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis, launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in India.When the air quality of Delhi on 18 November 2021 slipped to the "severe" category with the AQI at 362, the Supreme Court of India reprimanded the central and state governments asking them to take strict measures to reduce pollution in Delhi and NCR regions. </p>

            <h3 class="title">Food Waste</h3>
            <p class="text">A third of the food intended for human consumption around 1.3 billion tons is wasted or lost. This is enough to feed 3 billion people. Food waste and loss account for a third of greenhouse gas emissions annually; if it was a country, food waste would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China and the US. 

            Food waste and loss occurs at different stages in developing and developed countries; in developing countries, 40% of food waste occurs at the post-harvest and processing levels, while in developed countries, 40% of food waste occurs at the retail and consumer levels. 
                
            At the retail level, a shocking amount of food is wasted because of aesthetic reasons; in fact, in the US, more than 50% of all produce thrown away in the US is done so because it is deemed to be “too ugly” to be sold to consumers- this amounts to about 60 million tons of fruits and vegetables. This leads to food insecurity, another one of the biggest environmental problems on the list. </p>

            <h3 class="title">Plastic Pollution</h3>
            <p class="text">In 1950, the world produced more than 2 million tons of plastic per year. By 2015, this annual production swelled to 419 million tons and exacerbating plastic waste in the environment. Plastic pollution the world generates 300 million tonnes of plastic waste each year.
                
            A report by science journal, Nature, determined that currently, roughly 14 million tons of plastic make their way into the oceans every year, harming wildlife habitats and the animals that live in them. The research found that if no action is taken, the plastic crisis will grow to 29 million metric tons per year by 2040. If we include microplastics into this, the cumulative amount of plastic in the ocean could reach 600 million tons by 2040.
                
            Shockingly, National Geographic found that 91% of all plastic that has ever been made is not recycled, representing not only one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime, but another massive market failure. Considering that plastic takes 400 years to decompose, it will be many generations until it ceases to exist. There is no telling what the irreversible effects of plastic pollution will have on the environment in the long run.
